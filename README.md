How to use Github
First you need to create an account. Then you need to create a repository and name it anything you want. It can either be private, only you can view it, or public, anyone can view your repository. A repository is similiar to a folder that contains files. All the items in your repository are related to the same project. You can add a README file to you repository with information about your project. You can also create a branch which lets you have different versions of your repository. The default branch on a repository is called "main" but you can add more branches. To add a branch you click the "Code" tab on your repository, click the dropdown menu that says "main", type a branch name, and click "Create branch". This creates a copy of your main branch. To save your changes in your repository, you need to click the "Commit changes" button. If you can changes in a different branch other than main, you can open a pull request. A pull request allows you to collaborate with other people on your repository. Pull requests show differences between the content of the different branches. To do this, you click on the "Pull requests" tab, click "New pull request", click "Create pul request", add a title to you pull request, and click "Create pull request" again. You can also merge you pull request so that your changes in one branch can be incorporated into another branch. At the bottom of the pull request click on "Merge pull request" then "Confirm merge". You can also delete the branch safely now that your pull request is merged and all changes are saved onto one of the branches. 

How to use Git.
Git is an open-source version control system that can be used with Github. First, you need to install Git. Then create a repository with a git hosting tool such as Visual Studio Code. Once installed, change your terminal so that it is on "Git Bash". There you can use git commands to transfer changes or files to github. Some commands are: git clone, git commit, git status, git add, git merge, git pull, git branch, git push, etc. 

How to use Webstorm.
To use Webstorm, you need to download it using this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
Once you download it, you will be directed to start a project. To start a project you can either clone a repository (get an existing project from Git or GitHub), start a new project (create an empty project from an existing template), or open a project that is already on your machine. You can also start with the playground project to get a quick tour of some of Webstorm's key features. To create a file, open the "Project" tool window, select the folder where you want the file to be, choose "New", and select the file type from the list that is shows.
